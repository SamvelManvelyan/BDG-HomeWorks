#  7. Write a Python program to print the floating numbers upto 2 decimal places
# (number must be not greater than 10)
# Example:
# Sample = 2.145548
# Expected - 2.14
# _______________________
# Sample = 9.5748
# Expected - 9.57


sample_float1 = 2.145548
sample_float2 = 9.5748

result1 = str(sample_float1)[:4]
result2 = str(sample_float2)[:4]
